        <h2>4. Web Browsing</h2>
        <p>
            TTS Browser includes a web browser component that allows you to navigate to websites. 
            <strong>Important:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not collect or store your browsing history</li>
            <li>We do not access or store cookies from websites you visit</li>
            <li>We do not monitor or log the URLs you enter</li>
            <li>All web browsing is handled locally on your device</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Please note that websites you visit may have their own privacy policies and may collect 
            information according to their own terms. We are not responsible for the privacy practices 
            of external websites.
        </p>
        
        <h2>5. Text-to-Speech Functionality</h2>
        <p>
            The text-to-speech (TTS) feature uses your device's built-in TTS engine provided by 
            Android or third-party TTS engines you may have installed.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Text is processed locally on your device</li>
            <li>We do not transmit or store the text content you read</li>
            <li>TTS data is handled by your device's TTS engine according to its own privacy policy</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>6. Permissions Used</h2>
        <p>TTS Browser requires the following Android permissions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>INTERNET:</strong> Required to load webpages and display ads</li>
            <li><strong>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE:</strong> To check internet connectivity</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We do not request any sensitive permissions such as camera, microphone, location, or 
            access to your files.
        </p>
        
        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            Our app is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect 
            personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe 
            your child has provided personal information to us, please contact us, and we will take 
            steps to remove such information.
        </p>
        <p>
            The app is rated for users aged 13 and older in accordance with Google Play Store policies.
        </p>
        
        <h2>8. Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            Since TTS Browser does not collect or store personal data directly, there is minimal risk 
            to your personal information through our app. All data processing happens locally on your device.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, we cannot control the security practices of third-party services like AdMob. 
            Please review their privacy policies for information about their security measures.
        </p>
        
        <h2>9. Your Privacy Choices</h2>
        <p>You have several options to control your privacy:</p>
        
        <h3>9.1 Ad Personalization</h3>
        <p>You can control ad personalization through your Android device settings:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open <strong>Settings</strong> on your Android device</li>
            <li>Go to <strong>Google → Ads</strong></li>
            <li>Enable <strong>"Opt out of Ads Personalization"</strong></li>
            <li>You can also reset your <strong>Advertising ID</strong> in the same menu</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>9.2 Advertising ID</h3>
        <p>
            You can reset your Android Advertising ID at any time, which will disassociate your device 
            from previously collected advertising data.
        </p>
        
        <h3>9.3 Uninstalling the App</h3>
        <p>
            You can uninstall TTS Browser at any time from your device. Since we don't collect or 
            store personal data, uninstalling the app removes any locally stored app data.
        </p>
        
        <h2>10. International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>
            AdMob may transfer and process data in countries other than your own. Google complies 
            with applicable data protection laws and uses appropriate safeguards for international 
            data transfers.
        </p>
        
        <h2>11. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices 
            or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of any material 
            changes by:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Posting the new Privacy Policy on this page</li>
            <li>Updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy</li>
            <li>Notifying users through the app or Play Store (for significant changes)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically. Your continued use of the 
            app after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.
        </p>
        
        <h2>12. Third-Party Links</h2>
        <p>
            When you browse websites using TTS Browser, you may encounter links to third-party websites 
            or services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these external 
            sites. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of any website you visit.
        </p>
        
        <h2>13. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
            Since TTS Browser does not collect personal data, there is no data retention policy for 
            user data. The only data stored locally on your device are app preferences (such as reading 
            speed settings), which are deleted when you uninstall the app.
        </p>
        <p>
            For data collected by AdMob, please refer to Google's data retention policies.
        </p>
        
        <h2>14. Your Rights (GDPR/CCPA)</h2>
        <p>
            If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom, or California, 
            you may have additional rights under GDPR or CCPA:

            <li><strong>Right to opt-out:</strong> Opt-out of personalized advertising</li>
            <li><strong>Right to data portability:</strong> Request a copy of your data</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Since we don't collect personal data directly, most requests should be directed to Google 
            regarding AdMob data. You can manage your Google ad settings at: 
            <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/" target="_blank">https://adssettings.google.com/</a>
        </p>
        
        <h2>15. Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR)</h2>
        <p>
            For users in the EEA/UK, the legal basis for processing data through AdMob is:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> To provide a free app supported by advertising</li>
            <li><strong>Consent:</strong> You consent to this processing by using the app</li>
        </ul>
